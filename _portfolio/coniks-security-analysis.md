# Abstract

We explore the security goals and flaws of CONIKS,
 a security model that helps provide end-to-end encrypted com
munication systems with decentralized public key directories.
 CONIKS assumes a malicious key service provider and uses
 Merkle trees to publish privacy-preserving digests that can be
 audited efficiently. However, CONIKS implements two security
 policies, a default policy and a strict policy, which tradeoff
 usability and security. The default policy doesnâ€™t require key
 change requests to be signed, which makes key recovery easy,
 but leads to false positives or undetected malicious activity,
 while the strict policy requires signed requests, which provides
 cryptographic proof of any malicious activity but renders key
 recovery difficult for users. The lack of a definitive working
 key change policy is one of the main barriers that hinder the
 implementation of CONIKS in the industry. Nonetheless, the
 developers of CONIKS are still hopeful for a deployable version
 in the future.

# CONIKS Analysis: Why the Protocol Failed

## What is CONIKS?

CONIKS is a key transparency protocol designed to provide secure, decentralized public key directories for end-to-end encrypted messaging. Instead of trusting centralized key servers (like those used by WhatsApp or iMessage), CONIKS uses Merkle trees and transparency logs to let users verify that their keys haven't been tampered with by malicious providers.

## Research Conducted

This academic paper analyzed why CONIKS failed to gain industry adoption despite being technically sound. The research involved:

- Literature review of CONIKS documentation and related PKI systems
- Analysis of the protocol's two competing security policies
- Examination of why major companies (Google, Yahoo, Apple, Signal) declined to adopt it after evaluation

## Conclusion

CONIKS failed because of an unsolvable tradeoff in its key change policies:

- **Default Policy**: Easy key recovery but impossible to distinguish legitimate recovery from attacks
- **Strict Policy**: Cryptographically secure but users permanently lose access if they forget their keys

Neither policy was acceptable for real-world deployment. The inability to create a single workable key change policy that balanced security and usability became the primary barrier to adoption, leaving the fundamental problems CONIKS aimed to solve still unsolved today.
