## My Passion for Baseball Analytics

I love the game of baseball, and the analytics inherent to it. While there are a plethora of amateur and professional baseball analysts out there, I had yet to find a trade simulator or player valuator that was free and open source. A product like this could answer some of the biggest questions in baseball, when a team makes a trade at the deadline, how do we know if it was fair? How good will my franchise star be in 7 years? I wanted to fill this gap while testing the usefulness of deep learning in baseball analytics.

## Project Overview

Longball Analytics is a comprehensive baseball projection system that provides free, open-source player valuations and trade simulations. The platform combines machine learning with traditional baseball analytics to project player performance across all aspects of the game: batting, pitching, baserunning, and fielding.



## Key Innovations

**First Free Online Player Valuator**
Longball provides comprehensive player valuations and trade simulation tools at no cost, filling a gap in the baseball analytics space where similar tools are either proprietary or cost thousands of dollars for professional access.

**LSTM-Based Multi-Skill Projections**
The system uses Long Short-Term Memory neural networks to project performance across four distinct skill areas: batting, pitching, baserunning, and fielding. This approach to neural network-based baseball projections appears to be the first of its kind for publicly available baseball analytics.

**Prospect Valuation System**
Integrates prospect rankings from multiple sources to create composite valuations, helping teams and analysts assess minor league talent alongside major league players in trade scenarios.


**Arbitration & Contract Analytics**
The platform calculates salary arbitration projections and estimates Super Two status, providing insights into the financial aspects of player evaluation that are typically unavailable to public analysts.

**Interactive Trade Simulator**
Users can simulate complex multi-player trades with real-time impact analysis, seeing how proposed moves affect team payroll, prospect capital, and competitive balance.

## Technical Implementation

**Machine Learning Architecture**
Built custom LSTM models trained on historical baseball data to capture the temporal patterns in player performance. The neural networks handle the complex interactions between age, experience, and skill development that traditional projection systems struggle with.

**Full-Stack Web Application**
Developed a complete web platform using Flask and PostgreSQL, with interactive JavaScript frontend that makes complex baseball analytics accessible to casual fans and analysts alike.

**Open Source Approach**
All code is publicly available, contributing to the baseball analytics community and allowing others to build upon the work or adapt it for different sports or applications.

## Impact & Results

**Community Resource**
Provides free access to advanced baseball analytics that were previously only available to professional organizations, democratizing access to sophisticated player evaluation tools.

**Technical Achievement**
Demonstrates the application of modern neural network techniques to sports analytics, successfully handling the multi-dimensional nature of baseball performance prediction.

**Practical Applications**
The platform serves fantasy baseball players, amateur analysts, and baseball enthusiasts who want deeper insights into player value and team construction without the cost barrier of professional tools.

## Skills Demonstrated

This project showcases end-to-end product development, from machine learning model design and training through full-stack web application deployment. It combines domain expertise in baseball analytics with modern ML techniques and user experience design to create a tool that serves both technical and non-technical audiences.
